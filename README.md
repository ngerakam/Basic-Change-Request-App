# Basic-Change-Request-App
A change request app

In project management, a change request often arises when the client wants an addition or alteration to the agreed-upon
deliverables for a project. Such a change may involve an additional feature or customization or an extension of service,
among other things. Because change requests are beyond the scope of the agreement, they generally mean that the client
will have to pay for the extra resources required to satisfy them.
